I have been tinkering with the web since it started. My passion is to enable people. Especially studnets with getting interested in the web and the people who make it what it is but also the technogoly. As there is not enough room in any curriculum for everything the web has to offer in terms of design, development and UX, I created this blog where I and guest bloggers can produce tutorials and series of tutorials to learn what industry experts think graduates should know. So go on get in touch and create your own tutorial for this blog."
